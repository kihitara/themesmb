To put content in the slider, open slidercontent/content.htm
and edit that file.

Each slide of content must be contained within the tags
<div class="contentdiv"> CONTENT HERE </div>

Anything placed within that must use inline styling.

For ease of use, keep all images and other files used
in the slidercontent folder within the theme.

You can make up to nine slides at any one time. They are
numbered automatically.
